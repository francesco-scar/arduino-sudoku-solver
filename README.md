# arduino-sudoku-solver
Simple sudoku solver using arduino and input from resistive touch screen

## What is that?
This is a simple project I made just for fun. In the future I will add more details, instructions and maybe comments in the code ;P (or maybe not, you know writing documentation that probably no one will read isn't funny at all...)
